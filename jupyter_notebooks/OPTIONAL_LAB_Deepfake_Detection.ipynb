    "## Feature Extraction\n",
    "Feature extraction is the foundation of our deepfake detection system. In this section, we extract over 50 distinct acoustic features from the audio signal that have been shown to differ between genuine human speech and AI-generated audio. These features capture subtle characteristics that may not be audible to humans but are statistically significant for detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Feature Extraction Matters\n",
    "Modern deepfake audio can fool human listeners, but synthetic speech often contains telltale patterns in:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Frequency distribution: How energy is spread across different frequencies\n",
    "- Temporal dynamics: How the signal changes over time\n",
    "- Voice characteristics: Subtle differences in timbre and resonance\n",
    "- Micro-artifacts: Tiny inconsistencies at millisecond scales\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Categories\n",
    "1. Spectral Features (Frequency Domain)\n",
    "These features analyze the frequency content of the audio:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Spectral Centroid: The \"center of mass\" of the spectrum, indicating brightness\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Real speech shows natural variation\n",
    "    - Synthetic speech may be unnaturally consistent\n",
    "\n",
    "- Spectral Rolloff: Frequency below which 85% of energy is concentrated\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Helps identify unusual frequency distributions\n",
    "    - Can reveal synthesis artifacts in high frequencies\n",
    "\n",
    "- Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR): How often the signal crosses zero\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Indicates voiced vs. unvoiced segments\n",
    "    - Synthetic speech may have unnatural ZCR patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "- MFCCs (Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients): 20 coefficients capturing voice timbre\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Industry standard for voice recognition\n",
    "    - Higher coefficients (10-20) particularly sensitive to synthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "- Spectral Contrast: Difference between peaks and valleys in spectrum\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Real speech has natural harmonic structure\n",
    "    - Deepfakes may show altered contrast patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chroma Features: Pitch class information\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Captures tonal characteristics\n",
    "    - Can reveal unnatural pitch stability\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Temporal Features (Time Domain)\n",
    "These features analyze how the signal evolves over time:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Statistical Moments: Mean, variance, kurtosis, skewness\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Capture the overall distribution of the signal\n",
    "    - Synthetic speech may have different statistical properties\n",
    "\n",
    "- Energy Patterns: Frame-by-frame energy analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Real speech has natural energy variations\n",
    "    - Too consistent or erratic energy suggests synthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "- Silence Ratio: Proportion of quiet moments\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Natural speech typically has 5-20% silence\n",
    "    - Synthetic speech often has abnormal pause patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Advanced Deepfake-Specific Features\n",
    "These features specifically target modern TTS artifacts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Micro-temporal Variance: Frame differences at 5ms scales\n",
    "\n",
    "    - F5-TTS and similar systems may be too consistent\n",
    "    - Captures unnaturally smooth transitions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Spectral Flux: Rate of spectral change\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Real speech has natural spectral evolution\n",
    "    - Synthetic speech may change too smoothly or abruptly\n",
    "\n",
    "- Phase Coherence: Consistency of phase relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Natural speech has moderate phase variation\n",
    "    - High coherence (>0.9) suggests synthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "- MFCC Dynamics: First and second derivatives of MFCCs\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Captures how voice characteristics evolve\n",
    "    - Synthetic speech often has unnatural dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "- Formant Bandwidth: Spread of vocal tract resonances\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Real speech shows natural variation\n",
    "    - TTS may have overly stable formants\n",
    "\n",
    "- High-Frequency Ratio: Energy above 4kHz relative to total\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Some TTS systems struggle with high-frequency detail\n",
    "    - Can reveal synthesis limitations"
